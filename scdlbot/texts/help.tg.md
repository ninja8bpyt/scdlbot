*Hi{message.chat.first_name}!* I download and send audios from videos/tracks/sets/albums in *MP3 128 kbps* with tags and artwork. Files over 50 MB are split into parts due to Telegram Bot API limit.

*Usage:*
_Send or forward_ a text message containing links and I will:
‚Ä¢ In *Download* mode: download every link I support (or use `/dl <links>`)
‚Ä¢ In *Links* mode: show direct download URLs for every link (or use `/link <links>`)
‚Ä¢ In *Ask* mode: scan for supported links and ask you to choose download or links
‚Ä¢ Use /settings to select working mode for messages *without command*.
‚Ä¢ Use /settings to toggle *Captions*.
‚Ä¢ [Privacy mode](https://core.telegram.org/bots#privacy-mode) is _disabled_, so I scan every group message.
‚Ä¢ Supported links and resources:
*SoundCloud*: tracks/playlists/pages with private widgets
*Bandcamp*: tracks/albums/custom links
*YouTube*: videos/playlists/_not_ lives
*Yandex.Music*: tracks/albums
*Mixcloud, Vimeo and Many More but no VK music*
